# B.E.E - Brave Explorer Evangeline

Be a bee. A brave bee... a **very** brave bee.
Meet **Evangeline** - the bravest of bees.

## How to play

Zoom around in the endless, procedurally generated world and collect nectar.

### Controls

There are many ways to control Evangeline.

|       Keys         |  Action                       
|----------------|----------
| W / S |  Forward / Backward
| A / D |  Strive left / right
| Q / E |  Roll left / right
| R / F |  Up / Down
| Arrow up / down|  Pitch forward / backward
| Arrow left / right|  Yaw forward / backward
| Space | Speed boost  

Alternatively, you can use the mouse to control pitch and yaw.

Or use the touchpads? (if not visible => check the options page)

### What to do

* Collect nectar to get faster.
* Bring back 10 nectar to your home. 
* (rinse and repeat)

### Conditions
There are none - we ran out of time.
Death is hinted at in one case.
Winning is not possible as the only thing in live that is certain, is death.

## Key features

* Procedurally generated map (no limit set)
* Awesome effect sounds (not the background / ambience though - these were stolen)
* Somewhat playable (maybe even on mobile through browser)
* **Neverending** *"fun"*?

* Boost bar overlaps nectar count
* Boost can be used while not moving (on purpose, trust us :D)
